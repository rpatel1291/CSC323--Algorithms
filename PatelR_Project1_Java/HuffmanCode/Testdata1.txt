The Gettysburg Address
Four score and seven years ago our fathers 
brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, 
and dedicated to the proposition that all men 
We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate 
a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those 
who here gave their lives that nation might live. 
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining 
before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to 
that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that 
we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain
